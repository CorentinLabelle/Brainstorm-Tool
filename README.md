## Usage
### With MATLAB
The tool can be use with custom scripts in MATLAB. It requires to have Brainstorm installed ([here](https://neuroimage.usc.edu/bst/download.php)).

### Without MATLAB
See [compiled version](./compiled_tool/README.md).

### On CBRAIN
The [compiled version](./compiled_tool/README.md) of the tool will be available on [CBRAIN](https://mcin.ca/technology/cbrain/).

## Test
To test the tool, use the dataset and the pipeline from [this](https://github.com/CorentinLabelle/Brainstorm-Tool-Additional-Files) repository.
