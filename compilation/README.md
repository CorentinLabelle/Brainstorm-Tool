# How to compile the tool

1. Make sure [these requirements](https://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/Tutorials/Scripting#How_to_compile_Brainstorm) are satisfied.
2. Execute the function [compile_custom_brainstorm.m](./compile_custom_brainstorm.m) from Matlab.
3. A new file (brainstorm3.jar) will be created in the folder brainstorm3/bin/R20XXa. This file contains the compiled version of brainstorm and the compiled version of the tool.

Note: The latest [compiled version](../compiled_tool/bin) of the tool is already available in this repo.
